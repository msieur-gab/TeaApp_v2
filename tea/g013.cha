  "name": "Kabusecha",
  "category": "Green",
  "origin": "Japan",
  "description": "Kabusecha (covered tea) occupies the middle ground between sencha and gyokuro in the Japanese tea hierarchy. The tea bushes are shaded for about 1-2 weeks before harvest—longer than sencha but shorter than gyokuro. This partial shading increases chlorophyll and amino acid content while reducing tannins, creating a balanced tea with enhanced sweetness and umami.",
  "brewTime": "1:30",
  "temperature": "70°C",
  "notes": "With characteristics between regular sencha and premium gyokuro, kabusecha offers excellent value. The vibrant green leaves produce a bright, jade-colored infusion with a smooth texture, reduced astringency, and a delicate balance of vegetal freshness and rich umami notes.",

  "form": "Needle-shaped leaves, slightly more vibrant green than regular sencha",
  "brewingNotes": "Benefits from very precise temperature control; too hot water will release bitterness and astringency, masking the delicate flavors",
  "culturalContext": "Represents a pragmatic middle path in Japanese tea, offering many gyokuro qualities at a more accessible price",
  "alternatives": "If unavailable, a high-grade sencha can substitute, though with less umami character"
