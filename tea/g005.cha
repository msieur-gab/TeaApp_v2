  "description": "Sencha is the most popular Japanese green tea, made from leaves that are steamed to prevent oxidation, then rolled, shaped, and dried. This process gives sencha its characteristic needle-like shape and bright, grassy flavor with notes of seaweed, sweet vegetables, and a light umami finish.",
  "brewTime": "1:30",
  "temperature": "70°C",
  "notes": "Proper temperature is crucial - too hot and sencha becomes bitter. Multiple infusions are possible, with the second often being the most flavorful. The bright green liquor offers a perfect balance of sweetness, umami, and slight astringency.",
